# Feather
Simple Lootfilter for Diablo II: Path of Diablo

## Overview
This is a minimally-strict filter that hides very few items and includes many quality-of-life features.

## Features
* mostly follows classic style (it still looks like D2)
* non-equipment more clearly distinguished from equipment (gems, jewels, charms)
* items highlighted based on their usefulness
* notifications for valuable items
* item info (ethereal/socketed/superior/automods/skillmods) displayed
* shopping for valuable items made easier
* descriptions for possible runewords
* descriptions for craft/upgrade/socket/reforge/repair recipes where appropriate
* descriptions for maximum possible sockets where appropriate
* descriptions for item price on regular/magic/rare items

### Hidden Items:
* basic non-equipment: smaller gold piles, low-level potions, scrolls, keys
* regular items that have zero use for runewords
* regular skill-capable items without skills
* some additional regular/magic items without lasting usefulness

Note: If you copy/paste the filter's *raw text*, some characters may be displayed incorrectly - the file uses ANSI encoding instead of standard UTF-8 encoding. Either download the file normally, [download everything](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/Feather/archive/main.zip) and extract the file, or copy/paste the [*encoded text*](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/Feather/blob/main/feather.filter) into a file that uses ANSI encoding.
